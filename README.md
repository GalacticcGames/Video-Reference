# Galacticc Games Video Reference Repository

Any code created for example or tutorial purposes in our YouTube videos will be hosted in this repository. These will all be Visual Studio projects containing the necessary code and assets to replicate what we made in the video. Specifically, in order for the project to be stored here it will need to be in a *real* code language, not something node-based like an Unreal Engine blueprint.
